If you want upload and keep what used so far we can also create dirs for each member.

I think i will clean what uploaded so far, in particular paths and file names.

You can also save on drive best (so far) deep learned (number_attributes=1.5k) csv dataset in case you want to do some machine learning for only the classifier, but of course you need keras checkpoint of best model not uploaded due to size, so if you need i can upload train/test csv (of my best i mean) and pass links; if it can be usefull you can use deep_save to create deep learned csv from one checkpoint of your best global keras model (it takes the encoder in general); i used Orange, in case you know it, for mining a classifier externally, if you want or need it i will upload also that.
